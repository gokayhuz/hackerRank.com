my implementation to HackerRank problems by Gokay Huz

All problems have the same class name (Solution.java), but are
placed in different packages. The packages are named after the
problem title that is given on the hackerran.com page

My intention is not to provide a solution manual to problems
on hackerrank.com, allowing people an unfair boost to their
scores. I am posting these in case someone gets stuck in any of
the problems and needs a full solution.

All solutions are in JAVA, with very minor comments about the
problem. Please refer to the original problem statement
on hackerrank.com for details.
